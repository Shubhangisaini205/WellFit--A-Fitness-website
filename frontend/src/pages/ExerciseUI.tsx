You can start with either the dumbbells in front of your quads or off to the sides of your legs. Whichever is more comfortable. Also, whichever will allow you to fully extend your elbows at the bottom of each rep.Use a shoulder width or slightly inside of shoulder width stance.Â PerformingÂ Begin the rep by flexing your elbows. Try to touch your forearms to your biceps at the very top of the movement. Then begin the eccentric. Make sure to fully extend your elbows at the bottom of each rep so you get a full range of motion.Â It is easy to use momentum on a bicep curl. We want our muscles and not momentum to do the work. So make sure you keep these strict. If you find yourself swinging the weight up, then your biceps have hit fatigue and it's time to end the set.\n"
