    <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold mt-5 md:mt-0 mb-8 md:mb-10 lg:mb-12 text-left">Stretching is Compulsory</h2>
    <p className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-6 lg:mb-10 leading-8 lg:leading-9">Regular stretching exercises help to increase the flexibility of muscles and joints. It allows muscles to extend and contract efficiently, resulting in improved posture, mobility, and ease of movement. Increased flexibility also reduces the risk of muscle strains and injuries during physical activities.</p>
    <p className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl leading-8 lg:leading-9">Stretching helps to prevent injuries by increasing the elasticity and flexibility of muscles and tendons. When muscles are more supple, they are less likely to strain or tear during sudden movements or strenuous activities. Incorporating stretching into regular exercise routines can help maintain muscle balance, improve joint stability, and reduce the risk of injuries.</p>

    <p className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl leading-relaxed mb-8 md:mb-12">
      Meditation is a practice that has been embraced for centuries, and its importance continues to grow in our modern world. It involves training the mind to focus and redirect thoughts, ultimately promoting mental clarity, emotional well-being, and inner peace.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl leading-relaxed">
      One of the significant benefits of meditation is its positive impact on mental health. Regular practice has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, improve mood, and enhance overall emotional well-being. By observing thoughts and emotions without judgment, individuals develop a greater understanding of their inner workings and can respond to challenging situations with greater equanimity.

    <p className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-6 lg:mb-10 leading-8 lg:leading-9">
      Strength is essential for performing daily activities with ease and efficiency. From lifting objects and carrying groceries to climbing stairs and maintaining balance, having adequate strength ensures that we can meet the physical demands of daily life and maintain independence.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl leading-8 lg:leading-9">
      Strength training has numerous psychological benefits. It can increase self-confidence, improve body image, and boost self-esteem. Regular exercise releases endorphins, the "feel-good" hormones, which promote positive mental health and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.
